## Description:

For the second IART project, we have build a machine learning model that can predict whether a customer will subscribe to a bank term deposit based on a variety of features.

Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

## How it works:

-Reads the dataset from an Excel file using pd.read_excel function.
-Fills empty columns in the dataset with default values using fillna function.
-Removes rows from the dataset that have specific values in certain columns using boolean indexing.
-Balances the dataset by randomly removing rows from the majority class to match the count of the minority class.
-Uses 4 algorithms to predict the main objetive (Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decisions Trees, Neural Networks and Random)
-Prints the selected metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1)
